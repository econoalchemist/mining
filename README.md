Mining profitability data.
Here is some data I gathered from GlassNode. The date range is July 12 2020 through July 10 2021.

This data provides four different electricity rates: $0.03/kWh, $0.08/kWh, $0.13/kWh, & $0.25/kWh to help a range users. 

The BTC price in USD is the daily close. 
The daily mean hashrate is used. 
This data demonstrates running a single ASIC rated for 80Th/s consuming 3,500 Watts.
The block subsidy used is 6.25 BTC/block. The total reward is absolute in terms of the number of blocks mined on a particular day plus the transaction fees for each day.
